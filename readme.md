# retro-filter

This is a simple image processing app as my first demo project in Rust.
The retro filter can do the following:

- Add a vignette to an image. The vignette aims to be realistic and is optimized to not show banding.
- [ToDo: Add film Grain to image]
- [ToDo: Add bleach bypass effect to image]

The crate consists of a binary for the gui app and a library which gives you the functionality for the image processing.
