# retro-filter

This is a simple image processing app as a learning project in my Rust journey.

The retro filter can do the following:

- add a vignette to an image. The vignette aims to be realistic and is optimized to not show banding.
- add a film-grain effect to the image [ToDo: more realistic look]
- add a bleach-bypass effect to the image

The crate consists of a binary for the gui app and a library which gives you the functionality for the image processing.
